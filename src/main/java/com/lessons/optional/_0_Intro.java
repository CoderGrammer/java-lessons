/*
 - Why such a lengthy course on Optional?
 - Well NPEs are a very common sight to most Java developers
 - It can be particularly annoying tracing the real source of the problem
 - There is often much confusion about the best way to handle them from endless null checks to setting default values
   and everything in between
 - The proposed partial solution to the problem, Optional, is used and abused in almost every PR/MR
 - The problem and solution are so ubiquitous that sub-optimal use really adds up over time
