/*
 - Welcome to this course on Java Optional and null
     - Why a lengthy course?
     - Optional is here to address issues around handling null references
     - null references in Java can lead to NPEs
     - a common sight to Java devs
     - Can be difficult to trace the real source of the problem
     - Often much confusion about the best way to handle them from endless null checks to
       setting default values and everything in between
     - In my experience there is little consistency in the way null is handled in most
       apps
     - The partial solution to the problem, Optional in JDK8
     - Often used and abused in almost every PR/MR
     - The problem/solution are so ubiquitous that sub-optimal use adds up over time
     - Its important to get the design approach right
     - We will go into a lot of detail
 - About this course:
     - We use Java 11 and later touch on Java 14
     - What are we going to cover?
     - By the end of course you should be confident:
         - Understanding the concept of null
         - In considering the best design approach for null in your application
         - In using Optional in a sensible way and making best use of its features
