/*
 - Null represents the absence of a value
 - Null was invented by Tony Hoare in 1964 (not in Java!) but in ALGO
 - He called null his 'Billion dollar mistake'
 - 30 odd years later adopted into Java and a host of other languages
 - In reality he didn't invent null the concept but rather the null reference
 - null or the absence of a value is a real concept e.g. animal.getBeak but the animal is a fish
