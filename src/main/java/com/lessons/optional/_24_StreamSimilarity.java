/*
 - Similarity to Streams
     - Many of the meths on Optional are similar to methods found in java streams
     - They are often used together which can be confusing
        - You might have an outer Stream of Optionals e.g. Stream<Optional<String>>
        - You might have a Stream which results in a single Optional e.g. findFirst()
     - The operations on streams are very useful and serve many use cases, therefore it
       is understandable that you might want to treat Optionals as Streams
     - This is now possible as Optional has some of the same methods as streams to
       facilitate this
         - â€¦and if this is not enough you can convert an Optional to a Stream with the
         stream() method
