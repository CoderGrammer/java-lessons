/*
Similarity to Streams
     - Many of the meths on Optional are similar to methods found in java streams
     - They are often used together which can be confusing
     - The operations on streams are very useful and serve many use cases, therefore it is understandable why you
       might want to treat Optionals as Streams
     - This is now possible as Optional has some of the same methods as streams to facilitate this
         - â€¦and if this is not enough you can convert an Optional to a stream with stream() method
