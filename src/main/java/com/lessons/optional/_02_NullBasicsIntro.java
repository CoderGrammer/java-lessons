 - Null represents the absence of a value
 - Null references were invented by Tony Hoare in 1964 (not in Java!) but in ALGO W
 - "But I couldn't resist the temptation to put in a null reference, simply because it
    was so easy to implement. This has led to innumerable errors, vulnerabilities, and
    system crashes, which have probably caused a billion dollars of pain and damage in
    the last forty years." See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare
 - He called the null reference his 'Billion dollar mistake'
 - 30 odd years later adopted into Java and a host of other languages
 - In reality he didn't invent null the concept but rather the null reference
 - null or the absence of a value is a real concept e.g. animal.getBeak but the animal is
   a fish
 - When you say employee.getMiddleName() and they don't have one, how do you represent
   this?
 - So the concept of null is not the same as the 'null' reference
